* COMMENT Project Management in Emacs
   I want to start learning more things about managing my projects in Emacs. There are some built-in project features in Emacs and the projectile package helps a lot with project management. This isn't currently urgent but its usability is sure to arise soon. Being able to export a latex file which draws info from multiple other files inside the projects directory is awesome. Looking into the future, this is probably going to be the most efficient way to get to writing my diploma thesis and any other big project I want to manage.
   
   Obviously there are a lot of things to do here, but here is a non exhaustive list of things to play around with in the spirit of project management. The order isnt strict but its the order in which I predict I will do these
   - [ ] Research the generals of project manangement and set important variables with the built-in features of project management in Emacs
   - [ ] Do the same, but for projectile, which helps an already set up project infrastructure a lot
   - [ ] Create a "playground" test project for trying out things
   - [ ] Think of a use-case for project management which is going to be in the near future and make it happen
   - [ ] Go deep in project management and start using the more advanced features Emacs provides
   
* COMMENT Long term ideas for things I can try [0/7]
These are interesting packages to check in the long term. But nothing to hurry with, as I dont need any of them urgently.
 - [ ] ERC is an IRC client for Emacs. Elfeed is an RSS reader for emacs. EMMS is a music player for Emacs. I could get around to configuring them in case I start using them
 - [ ] There are a lot of eshell configuration options which I can try if I ever get around to using eshell.
 - [ ] There is a mastodon package for Emacs (I am assuming to run mastodon from inside Emacs). If I try out mastodon, I cant see why I shouldn't use this.
 - [ ] https://github.com/daedreth/UncleDavesEmacs/blob/master/config.org An emacs DE config. The things that interest me the most here are specific to an emacs DE, the rest are pretty similar to defaults. If I switch to EXWM (which I will definitely try at some point) this might be helpful
 - [ ] SPEAKING OF EXWM, I MUST TRY IT. But although its Emacs and I will be comfortable in it from the get go, its definitely going to be time consuming so I am stalling it for now cause I dont want to spend all my time there. 
 - [ ] Flyspell dictionary check. Togglable english and greek dictionaries
 - [ ] Become an elisp guru and manage to write a correct function that finds the company-backend used and if its the latex one, makes the idle time significantly smaller, but then fixes it, if its anything else. I tried it but struggled to get a correct condition for my if statement. Its something to look into for the future though.

* About this config

Welcome kind stranger, to my Emacs config. This is the heart of my dotfiles and of my entire computer workflow. Mostly everything I do in a computer with only a few excuses, stems from here and I absolutely love it. Emacs is the most extensible program I have ever seen. It allows you to change basically everything, until you have an environment which suits you perfectly. This is a vanilla GNU Emacs install with a ton of configurations. Actually its not even vanilla Emacs at this point, as its probably got more things than some emacs distros like doom, but it uses the tabula rasa that is vanilla emacs and customises it with this extremely long config file to make it into my own Emacs. Vanilla Emacs is all about creating a computer environment with consistency between all your tasks which is 100% customisable. I doubt there is a single thing in Emacs that can't be changed. And for that very reason I absolutely love it. Its truly the perfect workflow for me as I have handcrafted it from scratch. 

I have drawn inspiration from a lot of other init.el's but the most apparent one is the spacemacs keybindings. I was a spacemacs user for a few months before deciding to start using this personal config for Emacs. I found its keybindings very ergonomic and although most things arent exactly the way they are done in spacemacs, the inspiration is apparent. For example the Space and , keys are leader keys which I use a lot (space for general commands and , for mode specific, currently only org though).

Note that I know little to no elisp yet (I am in the process of learning though), so some things are probably not done in the most efficient way possible, but everything I have set has its desired behaviour, which is enough for me.

I hope you will find something useful here that you can put to your emacs config as well. Below, is the Table of Contents for my config as it has grown to be quite lengthy. Enjoy!!

Setting up my packages to work properly. 
The first section has to do with packages installed from melpa, the second with packages installed manually to my load path and the third about auto-updates to my packages which will be issued once a week.

* Sensible Defaults
Change some Emacs defaults to things I consider more sensible for my use cases.
This includes: 
+ Activating gcmh mode, which helps improve my startup time (Note that to truly get a benefit from this it needs to be very early on in the config). 
+ Setting my theme to doom's variant of dracula. I initially didnt switch to dracula because Emacs' default dracula is not appealing to me, but after trying the doom variant I fell in love with it (you can get it from the doom-themes package).
+ Disabling some features which I dislike personally like the bars that comes by default, and the annoying sounds emacs makes when you type sth wrong.
+ Activating which-key-mode, which is a popup prompt to display how to complete an emacs command.
+ Changing the startup screen to dired because I consider it way more productive than the default.
+ Activating ivy-mode my favourite emacs completion framework. I feel its really counter-productive to not use a completion framework such as Ivy/Helm/Ido. I also activate the all-the-icons integration for ivy. This is primarily for my switch-buffer command. I like icons
+ Changing the M-x menu to counsel M-x. With ivy-mode enabled you get an ivy M-x menu, but it doesn't have the keybinding associated with the action which I deem important. Thats why I set M-x to the counsel menu
+ Moving backup and autosave files to a tmp folder inside my .emacs.d so my directories look like less of a mess.
+ Adding the helpful package which makes documentations better (installing from MELPA didnt work so I needed to do the manual install)
+ Changed my modeline to the doom-modeline. It looks better than the default modeline in Emacs imo
+ Changing yes-no prompts to y-n, because its simply easier to type than yes-no.
+ Hide elements such as asterisks when writing a bold word by default. In the [[*Utilities][Utilities]] section of the config, I also define a function which toggles this behaviour
+ Set my font to Source Code Pro with the right font size for me.

* Utilities
General utilities that I want enabled when editing, or changes to the way emacs opens some programs.
This enables:
+ Enabling yasnippet snippets.
+ Enabling general, a package that helps me define keybindings easier.
+ Remove the warnings Emacs gives when opening large files or following vc controlled symlinks. I dont need them and they can be annoying.
+ Changing the heading and title font to match my global font and resizing them so 1st tier headings and titles actually stand out like they should.
+ A function to toggle the behaviour of markup elements such as visible asterisks when writing a message in bold. I dont like seeing them usually, but its good to have a function which toggle this behaviour
+ Setting the spotify id which counsel needs to be able to control spotify through Emacs.

* Keybindings
  This is my absolute favourite section of this entire config. But its a very big part of my config and I considered it more prudent to include it as its own file. You can find [[https://github.com/AuroraDragoon/Dotfiles/blob/master/emacs/.emacs.d/libs/keybindings.org][keybindings.org]] inside the libs directory (which contains all the external elisp "libraries" I have installed manually). The org file is the literate configuration of my keybindings. In that directory you will also find the keybindings.el file which I require in this section of the config to load. It acts as if it was an external package for Emacs which helps make this config more tidy. 

  #+BEGIN_SRC elisp

    (require 'keybindings)

  #+END_SRC
  
** COMMENT For my own convenience, a link to the keybindings.org file
   The link above points to keybindings.org in git. For my convenience, while editing this file I want a clickable link to my keybindings file, outside of the command I have for it. [[~/.emacs.d/libs/keybindings.org]]
   
* Dired
  Dired is Emacs's built in file manager (stands for directory editor) As dired is my Emacs startup screen as mentioned before, I have some customisations for it which are pretty neat.
  I have configured it to include:
  + Icons alongside each file which represent what type of file it is.
  + Hiding dotfiles by default (The keychord SPC d h, will show all the dotfiles in the directory but I find hiding them better for initial behaviour).
  + Added the functionality of when a folder has a single item, directly go to that item (open if its file, display the directory if its a directory). This is how you vieew folders in github, which behaviour I really like it so since I found a package with this behaviour (dired-collapse) I added it to my config and hooked it to dired mode. 

  #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
     (require 'dired-x)

    (add-hook 'dired-mode-hook 'treemacs-icons-dired-mode)

    (use-package dired-hide-dotfile

    (use-package dired-collapse
      :hook (dired-mode . dired-collapse-mode))

  #+END_SRC

  This is how Dired ends up looking after these changes

* Useful Minor Modes
  I enable a lot of minor modes on startup and I also set some up for use. This section documents these modes. Which-key and Ivy are omitted from this section as they fit more in the [[*Sensible Defaults][Sensible Defaults]] section because every sensible person would enable which key and a completion framework such as Ivy for better Emacs usage.
+ When adding a bracket or quote add its pair as well for quicker editing.
+ When the cursor is on one bracket, highlight its matching bracket.
+ Setting my wolfram alpha ID for use in emacs which allows me to query the website from inside Emacs
+ Activating undo-tree-mode everywhere.
+ Calfw is a calendar app for Emacs. Calfw-git allows you to see your git commit history inside of calfw while calfw-org shows org-todos in a calendar interface.
+ Audio files, obscure image files and MS/Libre Office documents don't open properly inside Emacs. I set up openwith to open them with external files.
+ Loading projectile, to remind me to play around with it some day.

* Org-mode
Some settings (now using the word some here might be an underestimation, as with the keybindings in a seperate file this is about half my config, but I like Org) I want for Emacs's Org-mode which I use extensively (like for writing this literate config file). Its split in sections cause its too huge otherwise. 

** Setting up external packages for org
   This first section is about some packages I load for org, which are very helpful for my workflow, such as:
   + Better headings for org, as I am not a fan of the default asterisks.
   + I load org-download after org, this is a helpful addon which allows me to paste photos on my clipboard to org, which makes adding photos to org documents much faster.
   + I activate calctex and activate it when I go into calc's embedded mode. Its a neat package that allows me to type a formula inside calc and renders it automatically into latex. Latex snippets are what I use mostly (you can find them inside the snippets directory of my .emacs.d but if you want to draw inspiration from somewhere there are much better sources tbh).
   + I activate org-cdlatex-mode which makes typing latex equations easier inside org and massively improves speed of typing equations together with snippets for org
   + Also add org-tree-slide from presentations inside Org
   + Require the org export beamer package so beamer export options are there by default
     
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp

    (add-hook 'org-mode-hook #'(lambda ()
				 (org-superstar-mode)
				 (org-superstar-configure-like-org-bullets)))

  (require 'org-tree-slide)

  (require 'ox-beamer)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: ox-beamer

** Org mode utilities
   I change some more things inside org to fix some annoying default behaviours.
   + When exporting to pdf, org defaults to your system's default pdf viewer. Since I am in an Emacs buffer editing the file, its more convenient to open the pdf inside Emacs with pdf-tools.
   + I write a lot of equations in my documents usually with latex and the normal size of those inside org (available with org-latex-preview) is a bit small for my liking so after playing around with it a bit I scaled it up to 1.8 of the original which I consider a very sensible size
   + Making latex view my bibtex bibliography and export it properly. I took this from the org-ref docs as originally I wasnt getting proper bibliographic entries. It works with this.
   + I tell org that its odt export should be converted to docx as if I am exporting to a rich text editors format, its for a collaboration and most people I know use that format. If its a personal project I always export to a latex pdf because it looks better.
   + Defining a function which supresses the confirmation message for tangling an org document's source code and hooking it to the after save hook in org-mode. If I understand it correctly, it should automatically tangle after saving, if thats possible, which is handy for things such as this configuration.
   + I have a custom lambda function which I hook to the org-mode-hook (so it activates every time a new org mode buffer is opened) which automatically displays images I have added to the buffer, creates previews for latex code in the document, toggles truncate-lines so that I can see the entire text when opening the buffer (really can't understand why its not nil by default in org documents).

** Org Noter
   
   Org-noter is an excellent program for annotating pdfs using org. Its main problem is that when you open it it creates its frame in a new emacs window which for me is inconvenient, so I change that behaviour to open the notes the current buffer. I also make another change. Because the typical file that includes a lot of org-noter annotations is crammed with :PROPERTIES: arguments I use a custom function to hide them. They can be useful so I dont hide them by default, but instead make the function interactive (can be called from M-x) and when given the 'all argument on the prompt hides all the :PROPERTIES: arguments. Below is the source code for these changes. Also, since I am not the one who wrote the function have a link to the stack-overflow page where this is answered [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17478260/completely-hide-the-properties-drawer-in-org-mode]]

This helps keep this consistent by having those keybindings in that section. I track all my todo files in one directory, my org_roam directory (more on that in the next section, its an important part of my workflow). So I want every todo defined in that directory to be loaded inside Org-agenda.

   I define a custom function org-make-todo which makes an item todo, gives it a priority and effort value. I like this for initialization of a todo file as it helps with organizing tasks with which one is more urgent and which is harder outside of the already existing file system to manage different kinds of todos.

   I activate org-super-agenda which gives me very easy to use queries for anything you can think of. I use it in conjuction with org-agenda-custom-commands which allows me to define new agenda shortcuts within which I define my new custom queries, which fit my personal workflow. Also, because some of my todos are rather large I disable truncate lines inside the agenda buffer. This is supposed to be the default behaviour but for some reason agenda is disobedient.

* Org-Roam, References and the Zettelkasten Workflow
  This section is about my Org-roam setup and my reference management inside org. It is based on the slip-box (Zettelkasten) workflow. The packages that are most relevant to this are Org-roam (obviously) bibtex-completion (ivy-bibtex in my case), org-ref, Org-roam-bibtex. Org Roam is a tool which helps you create your own network of notes. Its based on the Zettelkasten method and the Roam Research website. Everything is linked with one another. Bibtex completion (and the existence of .bib files in general) as well as Org-ref help manage bibliographic references inside org. I use Zotero as my reference manager in which I gather my bibliographies. It exports a .bib file which these two use. Org Roam Bibtex (ORB) is a package that combines all of these to help you add citation links from org-ref inside an org-roam buffer. This section includes all the customisations and settings of these packages.
  As seen in the [[*Keybindings][Keybindings]] section of the config, Roam and the Reference system both use the "r" leader key. Outside of it being handy because both start with the letter r, I think this makes sense because they are two connected concepts in my opinion. Thats why they are also in the same heading here.

** Initialisation Variables
   This section is all about the initialisation of variables. These are essential for the packages to work most of the time. More in detail,
   - I define the org_roam directory
   - Activate org-roam after emacs's init so I can use their commands from anywhere, anytime
   - Zotero exports a .bib file with all my references (the main way it "talks" to Emacs). I "tell" ivy-bibtex and org-ref the location of this file for usage in their various commands.
   - I allow ivy-bibtex to query by keywords or abstract. Can be useful
   - I define the directory in which org-roam-dailies should be put
   - I configure org-ref to use ivy-completions for its commands
   - I make the default action of ivy-bibtex, inserting the citation of the chosen reference. Personally, its the action I use most as opening the link/pdf to the reference (which is the original default) is more easily done from Zotero imo. In Emacs I find more utility in inserting the citation in my own documents.
   - Since opening the pdf, url or DOI of a bibtex entry is no longer the default action in my config, I bind it to the letter p in the options menu of Ivy-bibtex

* Skeletons
  Skeletons are a very neat feature of Emacs. Think of a snippet and a template, now combine them and you have a skeleton. A skeleton is bound to a key which when pressed enters a piece of text. This is helpful when initialising a file whose format is certain. I currently use this for initialising my lab reports which have a rather standard format all the time.

  #+BEGIN_SRC elisp

    (define-skeleton lab-skeleton
      "A skeleton which I use for initialising my lab reports which have standard formatting"

* Inkscape x Emacs
  This section is about integration of Emacs's org-mode with Inkscape. Essentially the first function, opens Inkscape, lets you draw whatever you desire and then creates a latex code area with the figure, ready to be imported. But, since saved the file as a .svg we need the second function, which exports the .svg to pdf so it can be imported properly to the Latex document Org exports.

  In a nutshell, you can use Inkscape to seamlessly create good looking graphs/shapes inside your org documents, which can prove very useful in some cases. I take no credit for this. I "stole" the idea from [[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/lo9ov0/latex_export_with_inkscape_images_and_drawio/][this]] excellent reddit post. I recommend you check that post out and not this section. The only problem I had with it is that the author initially planned for the second function to not be interactive but simply hooked to the org-export-before-processing-hook. This should work, but for some reason (at least in my config) this hook simply doesn't exist on startup creating an error while loading my init.el. After testing I noticed that if you export a file once in an emacs session, the hook is created and this works perfectly. But since I can't get it on startup and its tedious to do otherwise, I just made the function interactive so I can call it from the M-x menu and from a custom keybinding. If you however don't have this issue, the fix (as can be seen in the reddit post, which I recommend at least checking out) is removing the (interactive) (which isn't mandatory, but you wont need to call the function if its hooked to the correct hook) and adding a variable arg as the function's argument (this is needed for the hook to call the function correctly, but isn't needed if the function is called interactively).

  Big thanks to u/ozzopp on reddit for providing the source code for this as its truly amazing but something I couldn't have made on my own.

* Company
  Company is a minor mode, which I enable globally, which allows for autocompletions. This is useful when programming, or writing latex for completing what you want, but also can speed up the writing of long words. The lambda I add to the company-mode-hook adds latex autocompletions and allows them to be used anywhere. It also sets up company to read and give autocompletions for citations from my master .bib file in Zotero. I usually enter them with the ivy-bibtex package (my current default action is add citation there) but this is worth a try.

* Other Major Modes
Some other extensions inside my Emacs config that require some changes for their major modes to function as I want them. This currently includes:
- Ebuku
- PDF Tools
- Octave
- Emacs Application Framework
- Elisp
  
** Ebuku
  Ebuku is the Emacs major mode for buku, a simple terminal bookmark manager. Since I store all my bookmarks there, this gives me a way to launch my favourite pages from inside Emacs, which is a utility I deem very useful. For some reason, evil-collections keybindings didn't work by default so I enabled them manually (this is the first package I have had this happen to me with)

  #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
    (require 'ebuku)
    (require 'evil-collection-ebuku)

    (add-hook 'ebuku-mode-hook 'evil-collection-ebuku-setup)
  #+END_SRC
  
** PDF Tools

Configuration for PDF-tools, my favourite Emacs pdf viewer. I set it as the default pdf viewer for Emacs and enable the midnight minor mode for it as it makes it match my dark theme which is cool.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp

    (use-package pdf-tools
      :mode (("\\.pdf\\'" . pdf-view-mode))
      :config
      ;(define-key pdf-view-mode-map [remap quit-window] #'kill-current-buffer)
      (progn
	(pdf-tools-install))
      )

  (add-hook 'pdf-view-mode-hook 'pdf-view-midnight-minor-mode)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
| pdf-tools-enable-minor-modes | pdf-view-midnight-minor-mode |

** Octave
   Octave is a very powerful piece of software for mathematical computations. You can edit octave scripts inside of Emacs and also run an instance of Octave to execute them. But I ran into some problems with it. Some files with the .m extension weren't being opened in the Octave major mode, so I fix that.
   Furthermore, it was inconvenient for Octave to open in my current working directory so when I launch it I want to automatically cd to the directory holding all my Octave scripts. For this one I needed to create an "init_octave.m" file inside my .emacs.d which octave always reads when starting inside Emacs. Inside it you just cd to "home/your_user_name/Documents/Octave". For some reason it didnt recognize ~ as my home directory so I needed to add the full path. You can find the file inside this repo.

   #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
      (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.m\\'" . octave-mode))
   #+END_SRC
   
** Emacs Application Framework
  
     EAF is a very promising package for Emacs giving it some useful gui apps that are not so easy to find in other packages (such as a browser) and in general a full suite of applications. Unfortunately its got a weird behaviour in tiling window managers such as i3 and qtile, which I use not allowing me to use Emacs commands inside its buffers. It seems that when the cursor is outside the Emacs buffer (in my bar) this fixes but its still annoying so its use is limited unfortunately.

   #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
     (require 'eaf)

     (require 'eaf-evil)

     (setq eaf-wm-focus-fix-wms '("qtile"))

   #+END_SRC
  
** Elisp
   Elisp is the internal language of Emacs. I enable eldoc-mode in Elisp and ielm which is just awesome for writing elisp. 
   
   #+BEGIN_SRC elisp

     (add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook 'eldoc-mode)
     (add-hook 'ielm-mode-hook 'eldoc-mode)

   #+END_SRC
* Custom Variables
These are some variables automatically generated by the "M-x customize" menu. Its better not to play around with this section of the config file as to not mess something up accidentally. I honestly almost never set something with the customize menu because I prefer writing it manually in my config. Gives me a sense of order really.
