* COMMENT Ideas for things to work on (Inspiration for most of these https://github.com/daviwil/dotfiles/blob/master/Emacs.org) [8/10]
  - [X] Counsel-imenu is a menu to jump around org headings. In big files as my config file, it can be helpful so I want to be reminded to bind it to a key. 
  
  - [X] :which-key argument allows me to define messages in which-key displayed for a keybinding. Will help with prefixes and such when I play around with it. For the leader key you can do :ignore t which makes it not function but displays the message instead of prefix.
  
  - [X] Open-with is a package that allows for specific file extensions to be opened externally. As dired has become my primary file manager of choice, this is useful for some things such as audio files and MS Office documents.
  
  - [X] Take a look at dired+ and dired-hacks. Both have additions for dired which I may want to use.
  - [ ] Set up dired-rainbow for better coloring in dired buffers. 
  - [X] Magit-todos is a package that shows todos in vc controlled files inside your git status. This can be helpful for tasks such as this. Adding todos to my README that will show up in the git status.
  - [X] Calfw is a calendar inside Emacs. Why not try it. It also seems to have interaction with org-agenda. If it can also interact with org-roam-daily-notes thats one more reason to use it. 
  - [X] elcord is a package that tells discord "Playing Emacs" for the lolz
  - [X] Set up Inkscape x Emacs integration (I found it in r/emacs [[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/lo9ov0/latex_export_with_inkscape_images_and_drawio/]])
  - [ ] The last section of the config, mentions other inspiring dotfiles which I can check out.

* COMMENT Long term ideas for things I can try [0/5]
These are interesting packages to check in the long term. But nothing to hurry with, as I dont need any of them urgently.
 - [ ] Seeing the presentations section reminds me that I want to eventually look into org-tree-slide for org presentations as it looks cool. Haven't gotten around to doing it yet though.
 - [ ] ERC is an IRC client for Emacs. Elfeed is an RSS reader for emacs. EMMS is a music player for Emacs. I could get around to configuring them in case I start using them
 - [ ] There are a lot of eshell configuration options which I can try if I ever get around to using eshell.
 - [ ] There is a mastodon package for Emacs (I am assuming to run mastodon from inside Emacs). If I try out mastodon, I cant see why I shouldn't use this.

* About this config
  :PROPERTIES:
  :TOC:      :include all
  :END:
This is my GNU Emacs literate config file written in org-mode. Its heavily documentated for that reason.

Emacs has truly become that one tool that has molded exceptionally to my workflow, that I can no longer live without it. I use it for most of my tasks at this point. This is a vanilla GNU Emacs install with a ton of configurations. I initially used Spacemacs, but the mentality of vanilla fits more with me. Its a blank slate on which I can do anything I want. Spacemacs felt like a different person's vision so I wanted to move to my own Emacs config so I can truly feel its mine. I feel I have succeeded at this in making it truly personal. Its definitely not the best config I have seen, nor is it for everyone, but for me, it does everything I want. And its truly incredible at doing all that. I can not imagine a better workflow than this. Thats why although its far from perfect, for what I use it, I can truly consider it a masterpiece in its own right as no other program can get even close to this. 

I have drawn inspiration from a lot of other init.el's but the most apparent one is the spacemacs keybindings. I was a spacemacs user for a few months before deciding to start using this personal config for Emacs. I found its keybindings very ergonomic and although most things arent exactly the way they are done in spacemacs, the inspiration is apparent. For example the Space and , keys are leader keys which I use a lot (space for general commands and , for mode specific, currently only org though).

Note that I know little to no elisp yet (I am in the process of learning though), so some things are probably not done in the most efficient way possible, but everything I have set has its desired behaviour, which is enough for me.

I hope you will find something useful here that you can put to your emacs config as well. Below, is the Table of Contents for my config as it has grown to be quite lengthy. Enjoy!!

* Packages
  :PROPERTIES:
  :TOC:      :include all
  :END:
Setting up my packages to work properly. 
The first section has to do with MELPA packages and the second with packages installed manually to my load path.
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp

  (require 'package)

  (setq package-archives '(("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/")
			   ("org" . "https://orgmode.org/elpa/")
			   ("elpa" . "https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/")))

    (normal-top-level-add-subdirs-to-load-path))

#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

* Sensible Defaults
Change some Emacs defaults to things I consider more sensible.
This includes: 
+ Activating gcmh mode, which helps improve my startup time (Note that to truly get a benefit from this it needs to be very early on in the config). 
+ Setting my theme to doom's variant of solarized-dark. I like it more than the default solarized-dark in melpa (you can get it from the doom-themes package).
+ Disabling some features which I dislike personally like the bars that comes by default, and the annoying sounds emacs makes when you type sth wrong.
+ Activating which-key-mode, which is a popup prompt to display how to complete an emacs command.
+ Changing the startup screen to dired because I consider it way more productive than the default.
+ Activating ivy-mode my favourite emacs completion framework. I feel its really counter-productive to not use a completion framework such as Ivy/Helm/Ido. I also activate the all-the-icons integration for ivy. This is primarily for my switch-buffer command. I like icons
+ Changing the M-x menu to counsel M-x. With ivy-mode enabled you get an ivy M-x menu, but it doesn't have the keybinding associated with the action which I deem important. Thats why I set M-x to the counsel menu
+ Moving backup and autosave files to a tmp folder inside my .emacs.d so my directories look like less of a mess.
+ Adding the helpful package which makes documentations better (installing from MELPA didnt work so I needed to do the manual install)
+ Changed my modeline to the doom-modeline. It looks better than the default modeline in Emacs imo

* Evil Mode
Enabling Evil Mode, my preffered editing mode for Emacs, with the evil-collection loaded. It helps me with defining evil type keybindings for more programs, which I like. Then I also load evil-org which is a different third party program for evil keys inside org as evil-collection doesn't have that.

* Utilities
General utilities that I want enabled when editing, or changes to the way emacs opens some programs.
This enables:
+ Enabling yasnippet snippets.
+ Enabling general, a package that helps me define keybindings easier.
+ Enabling vterm-toggle, a package which helps with not getting a milion vterms open (with a run-or-raise behaviour)
+ Adding a message when Emacs launches telling me how much time it takes to launch.
+ Remove the warnings Emacs gives when opening large files or following vc controlled symlinks. I dont need them and they can be annoying.
+ Changing the heading and title font to match my global font and resizing them so 1st tier headings and titles actually stand out like they should.

* Keybindings
This is the "heart" of my config being all the keybindings I have set for my personal config. This is heavily customised as I personally am not a fun of the default Emacs keybindings (I find them a little too chaotic). Below is a table explaining them. When the keys are seperated with a space, you need to press one after the other while when seperated with a "-" you press all the keys together. Space (SPC) is set as my global leader key so most of my keybindings start with it. This is heavily influenced by the way spacemacs does it because I used spacemacs before this and I liked the idea. But, since it has way less keybindings than spacemacs they are simpler. I manage most of these using leader keys from the general.el package. I also have "," for org-mode specific commands (which can only be ran from an org mode buffer) as they are too many to have in the same leader key. I can also nest leader keys inside other leader keys, like how r is the leader key for org-roam commands both in the general keybindings and the org specific keybindings.

** Global keybindings, defined with the space leader key
| Keybinding   | Action                                                                                                                                             |
|--------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| SPC !        | Create a prompt for inputing a single shell command. This is easier than opening a terminal emulator for quick tasks                               |
| SPC p        | Opens the package install prompt                                                                                                                   |
| SPC o        | Starts the octave client. I use octave a lot for my lessons so this is a must for me                                                               |
| SPC H        | Create a horizontal split inside Emacs                                                                                                             |
| SPC V        | Create a vertical split inside Emacs                                                                                                               |
| SPC m        | Open magit, the emacs git client                                                                                                                   |
| SPC Enter    | Opens vterm, my preffered Emacs terminal, for when needed                                                                                          |
| SPC t        | Toggles Emacs's default behaviour concerning what to do when it runs out of space in a line. I always want it to wrap around to the next line and  |
|              | continue the text there, so I need to toggle this in a some buffers (such as Org)                                                                  |
| SPC T        | Executes org-babel-tangle, which is the command used to tangle source code blocks to your config file (the way you make literate config files)     |
| SPC b        | Open the counsel-switch-buffer menu which allows switching buffers with relative ease (also has a preview of the buffer which is a neat feature)   |
| SPC g        | Go to a specific page inside a pdf                                                                                                                 |
| SPC R        | If Emacs crashes for some reason, this command restores the backup Emacs kept for this file (almost always results to no data-loss)                |
| SPC a        | Opens org-agenda. Technically an org command, but I want to be able to use it globally and not only in Emacs                                       |
| SPC C        | Activates the calc menu (originally C-x *). The two options I use from here are "c" for the classic calc major mode and "e" for embedded mode      |
| SPC w        | Query WolframAlpha from inside Emacs. Wolfram Alpha is a website which helps with advanced mathematical calculations. Its very helpful to have     |
| SPC B        | Open the Ivy Bibtex menu to open an article saved to my Zotero database                                                                            |
| SPC h        | Jump to heading with Counsel                                                                                                                       |
|--------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| *Dired*      | Dired is the Emacs file manager, below are commands specific to dired (bound to SPC d)                                                             |
|--------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| SPC D        | Asks for a directory and opens dired in that directory                                                                                             |
| SPC d j      | Opens dired in the current working directory. This is faster than simply calling dired when you want to switch between files in the same directory |
| SPC d h      | Toggle visibility of dotfiles inside dired. In the dired section I set them to be hidden by default, and this toggles that behaviour               |
| SPC d f      | Find a file inside a directory. I usually prefer just using dired but this can prove useful in folders with a lot of "chaos"                       |
|--------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| *Org-Roam*   | I use Org-roam for my notetaking. Its got a lot of useful commands. The letter r is reserved for it (SPC r for general and , r for org-specific)   |
|--------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| SPC r f      | Find file inside the org-roam dir. If it doesn't exist create it. Since this system follows a non hierarchical sorting system, the org_roam        |
|              | folder (which contains all these files) is cluttered. So this is the best way to find the file you are looking for. Also creates the file if it    |
|              | doesn't find it in the system.                                                                                                                 |
| SPC r b      | Choose a citation and add a note specific to it. Follows the "orb-template" variable                                                               |
|--------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| *Roam-Daily* | Org-roam has the ability to create daily notes for various subjects. SPC j commands create/open the various daily notes                            |
|--------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| SPC j c t    | Capture a daily note for today                                                                                                                     |
| SPC j f t    | Find the daily notes created for today (creates the file if it doesnt exist)                                                                       |
| SPC j c d    | Open the calendar and prompt for a date. Then capture a daily note for the chosen date                                                             |
| SPC j f d    | Open the calendar and prompt for a date. Then find the daily note for that date and show it. Creates it if it doesnt exist                         |
|--------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| *Calfw*      | Calfw is a calendar for Emacs. Its pretty cool. It also has an interface with org-agenda todos and one with git commits in it (bound to SPC c)     |
|--------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| SPC c b      | Open the classic calendar buffer of calfw                                                                                                          |
| SPC c o      | Open the org-mode calendar view. This is a calfw buffer which shows org todo items. It can act as an agenda view as well, seems legit              |
| SPC c g      | Open the git commit calendar view. This is a calfw buffer that also shows your most recent git commits. Its a cool view I reckon.                  |

|------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| , l        | Makes latex fragments inside org, render as pictures showing the equation. Helps ensure I havent typed something wrong without the need to export.   |
|            | Its also great if you prefer to view a document from the org buffer and not a pdf (for the various utilities you have inside org)                    |
| , n        | Opens org-noter, my favourite tool for notetaking from pdfs                                                                                          |
| , e        | Org export dispatch command for exporting to pdf or html.                                                                                            |
| , y        | Pastes a photograph from my clipboard, very helptful to speed up adding photos to my documents                                                       |
| , c        | Open an ivy menu to choose a citation to add to an article                                                                                           |
| , h        | Invoke a custom command which hides the properties of org headings. Check Org-agenda section for more details                                        |
| , s        | Store a link from an org buffer to insert to another buffer. I mainly use this with Roam to add links to headings                                    |
| , i        | Insert a link stored from org-store-link. Again used mostly with Roam                                                                                |
| , S        | Custom command to export .svg to .pdf files. This is a prerequisite for the Inkscape integration with Emacs to work. This is better explained in     |
|            | the Inkscape x Emacs section of the config, which is specifically made for this functionality                                                        |
| , I        | Set TOC properties for a heading. This allows me to create a ToC for big files such as this which are uploaded to github so they look better         |
|------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| *To-Dos*   | You can do a lot with to-do items in Org. These are the commands I have keybound which are specific to to-do management. They are under , t          |
|------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| , t p      | Changes a tasks priority                                                                                                                             |
| , t c      | Changes the todo state of an item                                                                                                                    |
| , t t      | Changes a tasks tags                                                                                                                                 |
| , t v      | Search for all tasks with a specific tag                                                                                                             |
| , t m      | Activates my custom make-todo function which sets todo state, effort, tags and priority for a task. I prefer it for todo initialization              |
| , t s      | Schedules a todo task to a specific date and time                                                                                                    |
|------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| *Zotxt*    | Zotxt is a package with some Zotero compatibility. I use Zotero for my reference management so its cool. I mostly use a .bib file it creates though  |
|------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| , z i      | Insert zotero reference link. With C-u it chooses the highlighted reference link inside Zotero (it needs to be open and have zotxt installed)        |
| , z o      | Open a zotero link if the cursor is on one                                                                                                           |
| , z n      | Open org-noter for a zotero article, very helpful for live annotations, which none can do as well as Emacs. Still experimental though                |
|------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| *Org-Roam* | I use Org-roam for my notetaking. Its got a lot of useful commands. The letter r is reserved for it (SPC r for general and , r for org-specific)     |
|------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| , r i      | Insert a backlink to connect to notes together in org-roam                                                                                           |
| Grave      | Open the Org-Roam sidebar. The grave key is the one under Escape. Its an "underused" key, but its in a convenient position imo so I like it for this |
|            | kind of utility.                                                                                                                                     |

| C-c C-d    | Lookup the current symbol at point. Not exactly sure of its use but its recommended in the helpful github repo so I added it                       |
| M-d        | Open my Emacs config. This is very useful for when hacking on Emacs so I can quickly go to my configuration file whenever I want to do any kind of |

* Dired
  Dired is Emacs's built in file manager (stands for directory editor) As dired is my Emacs startup screen as mentioned before, I have some customisations for it which are pretty neat.
  I have configured it to include:
  + Icons alongside each file which represent what type of file it is.
  + Hiding dotfiles by default (Pressing SPC and then h, will show all the dotfiles in the directory but I find hiding them better for initial behaviour).
  + A keybinding to create a new file from dired (I cant comprehend why this is not bound to sth by default tbh). Bound to C-+.

  For consistency the keybindings are in the Keybindings section of this config even if they are only for dired

* Useful Minor Modes
  I enable a lot of minor modes on startup and I also set some up for use. This section documents these modes. Which-key and Ivy are omitted from this section as they fit more in the [[*Sensible Defaults][Sensible Defaults]] section.
+ When adding a bracket or quote add its pair as well for quicker editing.
+ When the cursor is on one bracket, highlight its matching bracket.
+ Setting my wolfram alpha ID for use in emacs which allows me to query the website from inside Emacs
+ Activate company-mode everywhere. Helpful autocompletions, I dont see why not.
+ Activating Elcord mode for the memes. Here is what it does to my discord profile https://github.com/AuroraDragoon/Dotfiles/blob/master/screenshots/playing_emacs.png
+ Hooking magit-todos to magit-mode. This allows me to see todos in a git repo inside the git status.
+ Calfw is a calendar app for Emacs. Calfw-git allows you to see your git commit history inside of calfw. 
+ Audio files, obscure image files and MS/Libre Office documents don't open properly inside Emacs. I set up openwith to open them with external files.

* Org-mode
Some settings I want for Emacs's Org-mode which I use extensively (like for writing this literate config file). Its split in sections cause its too huge otherwise. I change way too many stuff in Org :D. 

** Setting up external packages for org
   This first section is about some packages I load for org, which are very helpful for my workflow, such as:
   + Better headings for org, as I am not a fan of the default asterisks.
   + I load org-download after org, this is a helpful addon which allows me to paste photos on my clipboard to org, which makes adding photos to org documents much faster.
   + I activate calctex and activate it when I go into calc's embedded mode. Its a neat package that allows me to type a formula inside calc and renders it automatically into latex. Latex snippets are what I use mostly (you can find them inside the snippets directory of my .emacs.d but if you want to draw inspiration from somewhere there are much better sources tbh).
   + I activate org-cdlatex-mode which makes typing latex equations easier inside org and massively improves speed of typing equations together with snippets for org
   + Also add org-tree-slide from presentations inside Org

** Org mode utilities
   I change some more things inside org to fix some annoying default behaviours.
   + When exporting to pdf, org defaults to your system's default pdf viewer (zathura in my case). Since I am in an Emacs buffer editing the file, its more convenient to open the pdf inside Emacs with pdf-tools.
   + I write a lot of equations in my documents usually with latex and the normal size of those inside org (available with org-latex-preview) is a bit small for my liking so after playing around with it a bit I scaled it up to 1.3 of the original which I consider a very sensible size
   + Making latex view my bibtex bibliography and export it properly. I took this from the org-ref docs as originally I wasnt getting proper bibliographic entries. I t works with this.
   + I tell org that its odt export should be converted to docx as if I am exporting to a rich text editors format, its for a collaboration and most people I know use that format. If its a personal project I always export to a latex pdf because it looks better.
   + Defining a function which supresses the confirmation message for tangling an org document's source code and hooking it to the after save hook in org-mode. If I understand it correctly, it should automatically tangle after saving, if thats possible, which is handy for things such as this configuration.
   + I have a custom function which I hook to the org-mode-hook (so it activates every time a new org mode buffer is opened) which automatically displays images I have added to the buffer, creates previews for latex code in the document and toggles truncate-lines so that I can see the entire text when opening the buffer (really can't understand why its not nil by default in org documents)

** Org Noter
   
   Org-noter is an excellent program for annotating pdfs using org. Its main problem is that when you open it it creates its frame in a new emacs window which for me is inconvenient, so I change that behaviour to open the notes the current buffer. I also make another change. Because the typical file that includes a lot of org-noter annotations is crammed with :PROPERTIES: arguments I use a custom function to hide them. They can be useful so I dont hide them by default, but instead make the function interactive (can be called from M-x) and when given the 'all argument on the prompt hides all the :PROPERTIES: arguments. Below is the source code for these changes. Also, since I am not the one who wrote the function have a link to the stack-overflow page where this is answered [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17478260/completely-hide-the-properties-drawer-in-org-mode]]

** Org-agenda and TODOs
    I set everything I need for TODOs and the org-agenda in this section. In the Keybindings section of the config you can see the keybindings I have set for each action while here are the configurations I want to make. This helps keep this consistent by having those keybindings in that section. I track all my todo files in one directory, my org_roam directory (more on that in the next section, its an important part of my workflow). So I want every todo defined in that directory to be loaded inside Org-agenda.

   I define a custom function org-make-todo which makes an item todo, gives it a priority and effort value. I like this for initialization of a todo file as it helps with organizing tasks with which one is more urgent and which is harder outside of the already existing file system to manage different kinds of todos.

   I activate org-super-agenda which gives me very easy to use queries for anything you can think of. I use it in conjuction with org-agenda-custom-commands which allows me to define new agenda shortcuts within which I define my new custom queries, which fit my personal workflow. Also, because some of my todos are rather large I disable truncate lines inside the agenda buffer. This is supposed to be the default behaviour but for some reason agenda is disobedient.

* Org Roam, References and the Zettelkasten Workflow
  This section is about my Org-roam setup and my reference management inside org. It is based on the slip-box (Zettelkasten) workflow. The packages that are most relevant to this are Org-roam (obviously) bibtex-completion (ivy-bibtex in my case), org-ref, Org-roam-bibtex. Org Roam is a tool which helps you create your own network of notes. Its based on the Zettelkasten method and the Roam Research website. Everything is linked with one another. Bibtex completion (and the existence of .bib files in general) as well as Org-ref help manage bibliographic references inside org. I use Zotero as my reference manager in which I gather my bibliographies. It exports a .bib file which these two use. Org Roam Bibtex (ORB) is a package that combines all of these to help you add citation links from org-ref inside an org-roam buffer. This section includes all the customisations and settings of these packages.

** Initialisation Variables
   This section is all about the initialisation of variables. These are essential for the packages to work most of the time. More in detail,
   - I define the org_roam directory
   - Activate org-roam and orb after emacs's init so I can use their commands from anywhere, anytime
   - Zotero exports a .bib file with all my references (the main way it "talks" to Emacs). I "tell" ivy-bibtex and org-ref the location of this file for usage in their various commands.
   - I allow ivy-bibtex to query by keywords or abstract. Can be useful
   - I then define the fields of a bibtex file that get queried to create a file with the notes of a reference and set the variable that controls if they should be used to true (already default behaviour though so not truly needed). These are defined here and then formatted in the orb-template. The third variable is about what extension the "file" section uses.
   - I define the directory in which org-roam-dailies should be put
   - Lastly, I make the default action of ivy-bibtex, inserting the citation of the chosen reference. Personally, its the action I use most as opening the link/pdf to the reference (which is the original default) is more easily done from Zotero imo. In Emacs I find more utility in inserting the citation in my own documents.

* Inkscape x Emacs
  This ection is about integration of Emacs's org-mode with Inkscape. Essentially the first function, opens Inkscape, lets you draw whatever you desire and then creates a latex code area with the figure, ready to be imported. But, since saved the file as a .svg we need the second function, which exports the .svg to pdf so it can be imported properly to the Latex document Org exports.

  In a nutshell, you can use Inkscape to seamlessly create good looking graphs/shapes inside your org documents, which can prove very useful in some cases. I take no credit for this. I "stole" the idea from this excellent reddit post [[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/lo9ov0/latex_export_with_inkscape_images_and_drawio/]]. I recommend you check that post out and not this section. The only problem I had with it is that the author initially planned for the second function to not be interactive but simply hooked to the org-export-before-processing-hook. This should work, but for some reason (at least in my config) this hook simply doesn't exist on startup creating an error while loading my init.el. After testing I noticed that if you export a file once in an emacs session, the hook is created and this works perfectly. But since I can't get it on startup and its tedious to do otherwise, I just made the function interactive so I can call it from the M-x menu and from a custom keybinding. If you however don't have this issue, the fix (as can be seen in the reddit post, which I recommend at least checking out) is removing the (interactive) (which isn't mandatory, but you wont need to call the function if its hooked to the correct hook) and adding a variable arg as the function's argument (this is needed for the hook to call the function correctly, but isn't needed if the function is called interactively).

  Big thanks to u/ozzopp on reddit for providing the source code for this as its truly amazing but something I couldn't have made on my own.

* Other Major Modes
Some other extensions inside my Emacs config that require some changes for their major modes to function as I want them. This currently includes:
- Ebuku
- PDF Tools
- Octave
- Emacs Application Framework
  
** Ebuku
  Ebuku is the Emacs major mode for buku, a simple terminal bookmark manager. Since I store all my bookmarks there, this gives me a way to launch my favourite pages from inside Emacs, which is a utility I deem very useful. For some reason, evil-collections keybindings didn't work by default so I enabled them manually (this is the first package I have had this happen to me with)

  #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
    (require 'ebuku)
    (require 'evil-collection-ebuku)

    (add-hook 'ebuku-mode-hook 'evil-collection-ebuku-setup)
  #+END_SRC
  
** PDF Tools

Configuration for PDF-tools, my favourite built-in Emacs pdf viewer. I set it as the default pdf viewer for Emacs and enable the midnight minor mode for it as it makes it match my theme.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp

    (use-package pdf-tools
      :mode (("\\.pdf\\'" . pdf-view-mode))
      :config
      ;(define-key pdf-view-mode-map [remap quit-window] #'kill-current-buffer)
      (progn
	(pdf-tools-install))
      )

  (add-hook 'pdf-view-mode-hook 'pdf-view-midnight-minor-mode)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
| pdf-tools-enable-minor-modes | pdf-view-midnight-minor-mode |

And after these changes, my emacs pdf-viewer looks like this. I didn't know what pdf to use so I put a LibreTexts document for Equations of States, which is close to my studies. xDD
[[https://github.com/AuroraDragoon/Dotfiles/blob/master/screenshots/pdf_view.png]]

** Octave
   Octave is a very powerful piece of software for mathematical computations. You can edit octave scripts inside of Emacs and also run an instance of Octave to execute them. But I ran into some problems with it. Some files with the .m extension weren't being opened in the Octave major mode, so I fix that.
   Furthermore, it was inconvenient for Octave to open in my current working directory so when I launch it I want to automatically cd to the directory holding all my Octave scripts. For this one I needed to create an "init_octave.m" file inside my .emacs.d which octave always reads when starting inside Emacs. Inside it you just cd to "home/your_user_name/Documents/Octave". For some reason it didnt recognize ~ as my home directory so I needed to add the full path. You can find the file inside this repo.

   #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
      (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.m\\'" . octave-mode))
   #+END_SRC
   
** Emacs Application Framework
  
     EAF is a very promising package for Emacs giving it some useful gui apps that are not so easy to find in other packages (such as a browser) and in general a full suite of applications. Unfortunately its got a weird behaviour in tiling window managers such as i3 and qtile, which I use not allowing me to use Emacs commands inside its buffers. It seems that when the cursor is outside the Emacs buffer (in my bar) this fixes but its still annoying so its use is limited unfortunately.

   #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
     (require 'eaf)

     (require 'eaf-evil)

     (setq eaf-wm-focus-fix-wms '("qtile"))
