* About this config
This is my GNU Emacs literate config file written in org-mode. Its heavily documentated for that reason. 

This is still very much a work in progress project, but its in a pretty usable state. I was a spacemacs user for a few months before deciding to start using this personal config for Emacs so some of its keybindings are heavily influenced by it. For example the Space and , keys are leader keys which I use a lot (space for general commands and , for mode specific, currently only org though).

Note that I know little to no elisp, so some things are probably not done in the most efficient way possible, but everything I have set has its desired behaviour, which is enough for me.

This is how my Emacs currently looks, and because I didnt know what file to screenshot, have my qtile bar's config
[[https://github.com/AuroraDragoon/Dotfiles/blob/master/screenshots/python_environment.png]]

I hope you will find something useful here that you can put to your emacs config as well. Enjoy!!

* Packages
Setting up my packages to work properly. 
The first section has to do with MELPA packages and the second with packages installed manually to my load path.
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp

    (require 'package)
    (add-to-list 'package-archives
		 '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/"))

    (add-to-list 'package-archives (package-initialize))
    (unless package-archive-contents
      (package-refresh-contents))

    (let ((default-directory  "~/.emacs.d/libs/"))
      (normal-top-level-add-to-load-path '("."))

* Sensible Defaults
Change some Emacs defaults to things I consider more sensible.
This includes: 
+ Setting my theme to solarized-dark (my favourite theme).
+ Disabling some features which I dislike personally like the bars that comes by default, and the annoying sounds emacs makes when you type sth wrong.
+ Activating which-key-mode, which is a popup prompt to display how to complete an emacs command.
+ Changing the startup screen to dired because I consider it way more productive than the default.
+ Making the M-x menu a helm menu which I consider much better than the default
+ Activating ido-mode which amplifies most menus by displaying available tab autocompletions.
+ Moving backup and autosave files to a tmp folder inside my .emacs.d so my directories look like less of a mess.

* Evil Mode
Enabling Evil Mode, my preffered editing mode for Emacs, with the evil-collection loaded. It helps me with defining evil type keybindings for more programs, which I like. Then I also load evil-org which is a different third party program for evil keys inside org as evil-collection doesn't have that.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp

  (setq evil-collection-setup-minibuffer t)
  (setq evil-want-keybinding nil)

    (evil-collection-init))

  (evil-org-set-key-theme '(navigation insert textobjects additional calendar))
  (require 'evil-org-agenda)
  (evil-org-agenda-set-keys)

  #+END_SRC


* Utilities
General utilities that I want enabled when editing, or changes to the way emacs opens some programs.
This enables:
+ When adding a bracket or quote add its pair as well for quicker editing.
+ When the cursor is on one bracket, highlight its matching bracket.
+ Enabling yasnippet snippets.
+ Enabling general, a package that helps me define keybindings easier.
+ Enable all-the-icons mode for the ibuffer which makes it look much nicer.

* Org-mode
Some settings I want for Emacs's Org-mode which I use extensively (like for writing this literate config file). Its split in sections cause its too huge otherwise. I change way too many stuff in Org :D. 

** Setting up external packages for org
   This first section is about some packages I load for org, which are very helpful for my workflow, such as:
   + Better headings for org, as I am not a fan of the default asterisks.
   + I require org-roam although I havent set it up just yet, to remind me that I eventually want to work with it
   + I load org-download after org, this is a helpful addon which allows me to paste photos on my clipboard to org, which makes adding photos to org documents much faster.
   + I activate calctex and activate it when I go into calc's embedded mode. Its a neat package that allows me to type a formula inside calc and renders it automatically into latex. Latex snippets are what I use mostly (you can find them inside the snippets directory of my .emacs.d but if you want to draw inspiration from somewhere there are much better sources tbh).
   + I activate org-cdlatex-mode which makes typing latex equations easier inside org and massively improves speed of typing equations together with snippets for org and org-zotxt-mode which helps org communicate with Zotero and draw articles/bibliographies for my citations which I have saved in Zotero's database
     
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp

  (require 'org-bullets)
  (add-hook 'org-mode-hook (lambda () (org-bullets-mode 1)))

  (require 'org-roam)

  (use-package org-download
    :after org)

  (require 'calctex)
  (add-hook 'calc-embedded-new-formula-hook 'calctex-mode)

  (add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'turn-on-org-cdlatex)
  (add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'org-zotxt-mode)

  (require 'org-tree-slide)
#+END_SRC

** Org mode utilities
   I change some more things inside org to fix some annoying default behaviours.
   + When exporting to pdf, org defaults to your system's default pdf viewer (zathura in my case). Since I am in an Emacs buffer editing the file, its more convenient to open the pdf inside Emacs with pdf-tools.
   + Org-noter is an excellent program for annotating pdfs using org. Its only problem is that when you open it it creates its frame in a new emacs window which for me is inconvenient, so I change that behaviour to open the notes the current buffer.
   + I write a lot of equations in my documents usually with latex and the normal size of those inside org (available with org-latex-preview) is a bit small for my liking so after playing around with it a bit I scaled it up to 1.3 of the original which I consider a very sensible size
   + Making latex view my bibtex bibliography and export it properly. I took this from the org-ref docs as originally I wasnt getting proper bibliographic entries. I t works with this.
   + Laslty, I tell org that its odt export should be converted to docx as if I am exporting to a rich text editors format, its for a collaboration and most people I know use that format. If its a personal project I always export to a latex pdf because it looks better. 

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (add-to-list 'org-file-apps '("\\.pdf\\'" . emacs))
  (setq org-noter-always-create-frame nil)

  (setq org-format-latex-options '(:foreground default :background default :scale 1.3 :html-foreground "Black" :html-background "Transparent" :html-scale 1.0 :matchers))

  (setq org-latex-pdf-process (list "latexmk -shell-escape -bibtex -f -pdf %f"))

  (setq org-odt-preferred-output-format "docx")

#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: docx
	    
** Org-agenda and TODOs
   This is where all the project management magic happens. I set everything I need for TODOs and the org-agenda. Later on in the Keybindings section of the config you can see the keybindings I have set for each action while here are the configurations I want to make. This helps keep this consistent by having those keybindings in that section. I track all my todo files in one directory "~/project_management" so I want every todo defined in that directory to be loaded inside Org-agenda.

   I define a custom function org-make-todo which makes an item todo, gives it a priority and effort value. I like this for initialization of a todo file as it helps with organizing tasks with which one is more urgent and which is harder outside of the already existing file system to manage different kinds of todos.

   I activate org-super-agenda which gives me very easy to use queries for anything you can think of. I use it in conjuction with org-agenda-custom-commands which allows me to define new agenda shortcuts within which I define my new custom queries, which fit my personal workflow. Also, because some of my todos are rather large I disable truncate lines inside the agenda buffer. This is supposed to be the default behaviour but for some reason agenda is disobedient.

** Org Babel
More languages to evaluate with org-babel (by default, only elisp is evaluated). I dont use this extensively but for those times that I need to evaluate code in org, its probably going to be in one of these so might as well add them.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp

  (org-babel-do-load-languages
     'org-babel-load-languages
     '(
       (python . t)
       (haskell . t)
       (octave . t)
       (latex . t)
  )
     )

* Dired
  Dired is Emacs's built in file manager (stands for directory editor) As dired is my Emacs startup screen as mentioned before, I have some customisations for it which are pretty neat.
  I have configured it to include:
  + Icons alongside each file which represent what type of file it is.
  + Hiding dotfiles by default (Pressing Space and then h, will show all the dotfiles in the directory but I find hiding them better for initial behaviour).
  + A keybinding to create a new file from dired (I cant comprehend why this is not bound to sth by default tbh). Bound to C-+.
  + For consistency the keybindings are in the Keybindings section of this config even if they are only for dired

  #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
    (require 'dired-x)
    (use-package all-the-icons-dired
      :hook (dired-mode . all-the-icons-dired-mode))


    (use-package dired-hide-dotfile
      :hook (dired-mode . dired-hide-dotfiles-mode))

  #+END_SRC

  This is how Dired ends up looking after these changes

* Other Major Modes
Some other extensions inside my Emacs config that require some changes for their major modes to function as I want them. This currently includes:
- Ebuku
- PDF Tools
- Octave
- Emacs Application Framework
  
** Ebuku
  Ebuku is the Emacs major mode for buku, a simple terminal bookmark manager. Since I store all my bookmarks there, this gives me a way to launch my favourite pages from inside Emacs, which is a utility I deem very useful. For some reason, evil-collections keybindings didn't work by default so I enabled them manually (this is the first package I have had this happen to me with)

  #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
    (require 'ebuku)
    (require 'evil-collection-ebuku)

    (add-hook 'ebuku-mode-hook 'evil-collection-ebuku-setup)
  #+END_SRC
  
** PDF Tools

Configuration for PDF-tools, my favourite built-in Emacs pdf viewer. I set it as the default pdf viewer for Emacs and enable the midnight minor mode for it as it makes it match my favourite theme solarized-dark, which I love. I also define the key "m" as the toggle for dark/light mode in the pdf (see the keybindings section for more details)

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp

    (use-package pdf-tools
      :mode (("\\.pdf\\'" . pdf-view-mode))
      :config
      ;(define-key pdf-view-mode-map [remap quit-window] #'kill-current-buffer)
      (progn
	(pdf-tools-install))
      )

  (add-hook 'pdf-view-mode-hook 'pdf-view-midnight-minor-mode)

#+END_SRC

And after these changes, my emacs pdf-viewer looks like this (its very similar to the look of my current zathura config, but thats kind of the point).
P.S. Of course its the same exact pdf as in my zathura screenshot, you might even think its the same picture :D
[[https://github.com/AuroraDragoon/Dotfiles/blob/master/screenshots/pdf_view.png]]

** Octave
   Octave is a very powerful piece of software for mathematical computations. You can edit octave scripts inside of Emacs and also run an instance of Octave to execute them. But I ran into some problems with it. Some files with the .m extension weren't being rendered properly as .m files.
   Furthermore, it was inconvenient for Octave to open in my current working directory so when I launch it I want to automatically cd to the directory holding all my Octave scripts. For this one I needed to create an "init_octave.m" file inside my .emacs.d which octave always reads when starting inside Emacs. Inside it you just cd to "home/your_user_name/Documents/Octave". For some reason it didnt recognize ~ as my home directory so I needed to add the full path. You can find the file inside this repo.

   #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
      (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.m\\'" . octave-mode))
   #+END_SRC
   
** Emacs Application Framework
  
     EAF is a very promising package for Emacs giving it some useful gui apps that are not so easy to find in other packages (such as a browser) and in general a full suite of applications. Unfortunately its got a weird behaviour in tiling window managers such as i3 and qtile, which I use not allowing me to use Emacs commands inside its buffers. It seems that when the cursor is outside the Emacs buffer (in my bar) this fixes but its still annoying so its use is limited unfortunately.

   #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
     (require 'eaf)

     (require 'eaf-evil)
     ;(setq eaf-evil-leader-key "SPC")

     (setq eaf-wm-focus-fix-wms '("qtile"))
   #+END_SRC
  
* Keybindings
This is all the keybindings I have set for my personal config. Below is a table explaining them. When the keys are seperated with a space, you need to press one after the other while in the rest you press all the keys together. Space is set as my global leader key so most of my keybindings start with it. This is heavily influenced by the way spacemacs does it because I used spacemacs before this and I liked the idea. But, since it has way less keybindings than spacemacs they are simpler. I manage most of these using leader keys from the general.el package. I also have , for org-mode specific commands (which can only be ran from an org mode buffer) as they are too many to have in the same leader key. I can also nest leader keys inside other leader keys, like how z is the leader key for zotxt (Zotero integration) inside the org keybindings.

** Global keybindings, defined with the space leader key
| Keybinding  | Action                                                                                                                                             |

| Space o     | Starts the octave client in the working directory of the file from which this was called. I use octave a lot so this is a must for me              |
| Space d     | Asks for a directory and opens dired in that directory                                                                                             |
| Space j     | Opens dired in the current working directory. This is faster than simply calling dired when you want to switch between files in the same directory |
| Space h     | Toggle visibility of dotfiles inside dired. The default behaviour, is for them to be hidden, and this toggles that behaviour                       |

| Space V     | Create a vertical split inside Emacs                                                                                                               |
| Space Enter | Opens vterm, my preffered Emacs terminal, for when needed                                                                                          |
| Space t     | Toggles Emacs's default behaviour concerning what to do when it runs out of space in a line. I always want it to go to the next line so this helps |
| Space T     | Executes org-babel-tangle, which is the command used to tangle source code blocks to your config file (the way you make literate config files)     |
| Space b     | Open the ibuffer menu which allows switching buffers with relative ease                                                                            |

| Space a     | Opens org-agenda. Technically an org command, but I want to be able to use it globally                                                             |
| Space c     | Activates the calc menu (originally C-x *). The two options I use from here are "c" for the classic calc major mode and "e" for embedded mode      |
| Space w     | Query WolframAlpha from inside Emacs. Wolfram Alpha is a website which helps with advanced mathematical calculations. Its very helpful to have     |
